# using-fhe-libraries

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computations to be performed on encrypted data. In cloud computing, this increases security by reducing the need to entrust secret keys to untrusted cloud servers. This repository contains driver programs for distance computation using existing FHE libraries, mainly Palisade and Microsoft SEAL, with the aim of gaining an insight into how we can choose cryptosystem parameters to achieve levelled FHE. The influence of the parameter values on the efficiency and accuracy of computation was examined through the tracking of execution results and durations.
